  <p>This project creates a simulation of a group of semi-intelligent agents
 working in teams to complete a group of tasks.</p>
  <p>The simulation takes place in a square room, n x n units in size. An
  agent takes up a single cell at any given time. Multiple agents may
  take reside in the same cell. The number of agents and the type
  of agent are specified by the user on the command-line.</p>
  <p>In the same room, a user-specified number of <code>Task</code>s are
  scattered.  No two tasks may occupy the same cell. In order for a task
  to be complete, it must be "executed" (touched) by at least five different
  agents.  Each time an agent executes a task, there is a 90% chance that
  the task will become "more" complete.  With a 10% chance it will actually
  become "less" complete.  The completeness of a task is indicated by the
  color: black is completely incomplete, green is complete, with the task
  becoming "more green" in between.</p>
  <p>There are a number of different types of agent.  In general, agents
  "wander" randomly around the room until they encounter a task.  Once they
  do, they automatically execute the task.  After that, what they do depends
  on the type of agent.  See the documentation for each different type of
  agent for more details.</p>
  <p>If this program is run from the command-line, the following properties
  may be used.  All arguments are optional, but if used, they must be given as
  system properties in the form <code>-Dproperty-name=value</code> as described
  below.</p>
  <table>
      <thead><tr><td>Property name</td><td>Value</td></tr></thead>
      <tr><td>type</td><td>Type of agent to use. May be irresponsible,
          responsible, mailbox, military, or prioritizing.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>agents</td><td>Number of agents to use. Default is 15.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>tasks</td><td>Number of tasks to use. Default is 100.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>roomsize</td><td>Size of the room in cells. Default is 50.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>stopat</td><td>The percentage of tasks that must be complete for
      the simulation to stop. Default is 100.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>showgraphics</td><td>true/false - render animation or not. Default is true.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>showhelper</td><td>true/false - render "helper" graphics (not 
              applicable to all agent types). Default is true.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>cellsize</td><td>Size of a cell in pixels. Default is 6.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>batch</td><td>true/false - Setting the program in batch mode sets
              showgraphics and showhelper to false and prints statistics to the
              console at the end of the simulation.</td></tr>

  <h1>Building your own agent</h1>
  To build your own agent, create a new Java class using the following template:
  <pre>
      import org.roach.intelligentagents.*;
      public class MyAgent extends CommunicatingAgent {
        ...
      }
  </pre>
  At a minimum, the class must override the following methods:
  <pre>
  abstract protected TaskToDo getCurrentTaskToDo();
  abstract protected void receiveMessage(Location receivedLoc);
  </pre>
  </body>
